# Succession Development

Develop potential successors by giving them access to decision-making processes, identifying skill gaps, and preparing them for leadership transition.

**Origin:** Bob Iger methodology - "At its essence, good leadership isn't about being indispensable; it's about helping others be prepared to possibly step into your shoes."

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create development plans designed to fail or undermine candidates
- Fabricate assessments of candidate readiness
- Recommend succession approaches that harm organizational continuity
- Ignore ethical considerations in leadership selection

**If asked to create a biased succession plan:** Refuse explicitly. Succession must serve organizational health, not political agendas.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How do I develop my successor?"
- Succession planning discussions are underway
- Leader is preparing for transition
- Leadership pipeline needs strengthening
- Post-succession failure analysis needed (what went wrong)

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **current_leader_role** | Yes | Role being transitioned |
| **successor_candidates** | Yes | Potential successors (internal and/or external) |
| **transition_timeline** | Yes | When transition should occur |
| **key_responsibilities** | No | Critical elements of the role |
| **skill_gaps** | No | Known development needs |
| **organizational_context** | No | Culture, challenges, strategic priorities |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Define What Success Looks Like

**Role Analysis:**
- What are the 3-5 most critical responsibilities?
- What decisions does this leader make that no one else can?
- What relationships are essential to the role?
- What knowledge is tacit and must be transferred?

**Success Profile:**
- What skills are required?
- What experience is necessary?
- What temperament fits the role and organization?
- What does the organization need in its next phase that it may not have needed before?

### Step 2: Assess Candidate Readiness

For each candidate:

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Technical capability | [Ready / Developing / Gap] | [Specific examples] |
| Leadership experience | [Ready / Developing / Gap] | [Specific examples] |
| Decision-making quality | [Ready / Developing / Gap] | [Specific examples] |
| Stakeholder relationships | [Ready / Developing / Gap] | [Specific examples] |
| Cultural fit | [Ready / Developing / Gap] | [Specific examples] |
| Strategic thinking | [Ready / Developing / Gap] | [Specific examples] |

**Gap Analysis:**
- What specific gaps must be closed before transition?
- Which gaps can be developed? Which are fundamental limitations?
- What timeline is realistic for gap closure?

### Step 3: Create Development Exposure

**The Iger Principle:** Give people access to your decision-making.

**Exposure Opportunities:**

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Shadow critical meetings | Observe decision-making context | Board meetings, strategic reviews |
| Lead bounded decisions | Practice with safety net | Department initiatives, project decisions |
| Stakeholder introductions | Build relationships | Customer meetings, investor calls |
| Crisis participation | Stress-test judgment | Active role in problem resolution |
| Strategy development | Test strategic thinking | Lead planning process for area |

**Key principle:** Candidates need to see HOW decisions are made, not just WHAT decisions are made.

### Step 4: Create Feedback Loops

**Regular Assessment:**
- Monthly development check-ins
- Quarterly progress reviews
- 360-degree feedback at milestones
- Real-time coaching after critical moments

**Development Adjustment:**
- What is working in the development plan?
- What needs to change?
- Is the timeline realistic?
- Are multiple candidates still viable?

### Step 5: Design the Transition

**The Chapek Lesson:** Clean transitions work better than overlapping authority.

**Transition Principles:**
1. Successor needs room to lead without predecessor shadow
2. Authority transfer must be clear and complete
3. Predecessor availability should be bounded and on-call, not constant
4. Board/stakeholders must commit fully to new leader
5. Grace period for style differences must be established

**Transition Timeline:**

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Announcement | Day 0 | Clear communication of transition |
| Overlap (if any) | 30-90 days max | Knowledge transfer, introduction support |
| Clean break | Day 90+ | Predecessor steps back completely |
| Check-in | 6 months | Scheduled review, available for questions |

### Step 6: Plan for Failure Scenarios

**What if the successor struggles?**
- Define early warning signs
- Establish support mechanisms
- Create intervention triggers
- Have contingency candidates identified

**What if transition is accelerated?**
- Emergency succession plan
- Minimum readiness thresholds
- Interim arrangements if needed

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No internal candidates ready | Assess external candidates; extend current leader tenure if possible |
| Multiple strong candidates | Create selection process; consider dual-track development |
| Candidate declines role | Understand reasons; adjust offer or identify alternatives |
| Current leader resists transition | Address directly; involve board if necessary |
| Transition fails | Implement contingency; conduct blameless post-mortem |
| Timeline accelerated unexpectedly | Activate emergency succession plan |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
```
Current leader role: CEO of 500-person tech company
Successor candidates: COO (internal), VP Engineering (internal), External candidate
Transition timeline: 18 months
Key responsibilities: Strategy, fundraising, culture, external relationships
```

**Output:**

[Full succession development plan following template above]
